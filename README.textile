h1. Documentation for the Hazelcast module

bq. This module is a dropin replacement for EhCacheImpl or MemcachedImpl from Play. 
It allow primarily to have a clustered cache when you can't install a memcached server on your platform.
It's also a great free open source *In-Memory Data Grid*

See "Hazelcast Documentation":http://www.hazelcast.com/documentation.jsp for more details.

h2. Installing Hazelcast Module

p. To install Hazelcast Plugin module, you do like every other Play Modules:

bc. play install hazelcast[-version]

h2. Using Hazelcast Module (Dependency management)

h3. There is two way to use the module


* The Play 1.x way (*in application.conf*)

bc. module.hazelcast=${play.path}/modules/hazelcast-[version]

* The Play 1.2.x way (*in dependencies.yml*)

bc.. require:
	- play -> hazelcast [version]

h2. Using standard Play! Framework Cache Mechanisms

p. All the standard Play annotations can work with Hazelcast instead of EhCache or Memcached.

See "Play Framework Cache Documentation":/@documentation/cache for *Cache.class* and annotations usage.


h2. Using features from Hazelcast

h3. Using @Inject to inject an instance of Hazelcast in your controller

bc. @Inject private static HazelcastInstance hazel;

or

bc. @Inject private static ExecutorService executor;

h3. Using @Named to inject a named resource 

bc. @Named("MyQueue") private static Queue myQueue;


h2. Hazelcast clustered services

* Distributed Queues (Entries are consumed by one and only one JVM)
* Distributed Topics (Entries are consumed by all JVM)
* Distributed Events
* Distributed AtomicNumber provider
* Distributed ExecutorService
* Distributed ID Generator (_ID are UNIQUE in all cluster nodes_)
* Distributed List (to share a list in the cluster between many JVM)
* Distributed Lock (_to apply a lock on an object and share between JVM_)
* Distributed Set
* Distributed Map/MultiMap (_Maps are shared between JMV, MultiMap allow for multiple values for the same key_)
* Distributed Transaction (_affect transactions on clustered objects, not database!_)

h3. Configuration file *hazelcast.xml*

You can modify *hazelcast.xml* to your need to create more Queues or Map and modify the default ExecutorService parameters. Just copy the hazelcast.xml file from the module _conf_ directory to your application _conf_ directory.
* Default name for the Map is "*default*"
* Default name for the Queue is "*default*"

h3. Hazelcast Object type that can be retreived via @@Named@ annotation

* Queue
* Topic
* AtomicNumber
* ExecutorService
* Set
* Map
* MultiMap

h3. Hazelcast Object type that can by retreived via @@Inject@ annotation

* Map
* List
* Set
* Transaction
* ExecutorService
* IdGenerator
* Lock
* Event
